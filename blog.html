				<p><b>What challenges or troubles did you have completing this assignment. How did you work through them?</b></p>
				<p>I have pretty good experience with HTML/CSS so I wouldn't say I had many challenges.</p>
				<p><b>What did you learn from this assignment? What did you already know?</b></p>
				<p>Again, I have a lot of experience with HTML/CSS so I don't think there was much for me to learn yet.</p>
				<p><b>What resources (e.g. specific web articles, the class Campuswire forum, the TAs) were most helpful in completing this assignment? How did you use these resources?</b></p>
				<p>I didn't use any outside resources for this assignment.</p>
