			<h2>About me:</h2>
			<p><b>What is the most complex or interesting thing you've done with your current web development skills?</b></p>
			<p>I built a <a href="https://duo-bypass.com">fairly simple webpage</a> to allow DUO mobile users to extract standardized HOTP codes from Cisco's proprietary software to allow the use of 3rd party OTP applications such as Google Authenticator.</p>
			<p><b>What do you hope to learn from this class?</p></b>
			<p>I feel pretty compitent with my HTML/CSS skills but most of the Javascript I've written has been pretty simple and patched together, so I would like to learn more in that area.</p>
			<p><b>Have you signed up for our course Campuswire forum?</p></b>
			<p>Yep</p>
			<p><b>The most interesting fact about you or the most unique experience you've had.<p/></b>
			<p>I've had a lot of interesting experiences, it's hard to narrow it down. This isn't the most interesting, but recently I had a lot of fun over the summer, coaching a bunch of skiers up at Mt. Hood during a summer camp called Party Beach Ski Camps.</p>
